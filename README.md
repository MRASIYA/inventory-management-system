## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Method 1: Create a New Repository

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and click "New repository"
   - Name it `your-username.github.io` (replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have files)

2. **Upload your files:**
   - Upload `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, and `README.md` to the repository
   - Or use Git commands (see Method 2)

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

4. **Access your website:**
   - Your site will be available at `https://your-username.github.io`
   - It may take a few minutes to deploy

### Method 2: Using Git Commands

If you have Git installed, you can use these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial website commit"

# Add your GitHub repository as origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Method 3: Using an Existing Repository

If you want to use an existing repository:

1. Upload the files to your repository
2. Go to repository Settings → Pages
3. Select source as "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose the branch and folder containing your `index.html`
5. Save and wait for deployment

## Customization

### Personal Information
Edit the following in `index.html`:
- Change "My Website" to your preferred site name
- Update the "About Me" section with your information
- Replace "your.email@example.com" with your actual email
- Update the GitHub link with your username
- Modify project descriptions to match your actual projects

### Styling
- Colors and fonts can be modified in `styles.css`
- The gradient background can be changed in the `.hero` section
- Responsive breakpoints can be adjusted in the media queries

### Content
- Add more sections by copying the section structure in `index.html`
- Add more project cards by duplicating the `.project-card` divs
- Update navigation links if you add new sections

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that all files are in the root directory of your repository
2. Ensure `index.html` is present (GitHub Pages looks for this automatically)
3. Wait a few minutes after enabling GitHub Pages for the site to become available
4. Check the Pages section in your repository settings for any error messages
